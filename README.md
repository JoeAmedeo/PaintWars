# PaintWars

## Purpose

Some time way back when, a group of friends came up with a game to play when League of Legends servers where down. This game involved thinking of topics, and using MS Paint in order to let our creativity flow and make hilariously bad pictures, which we would rate and determine which was the best. Think of it like a combination of Cards Against Humanity and Pictionary.
